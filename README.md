# About Me:
Hi, I’m Jason Avalos a Computer Science student at California State University, Fresno who enjoys building practical software with a focus on usability and real-world impact. I’m currently working on Parking Pal, a team-built app that connects a PostgreSQL database with a FastAPI backend and a modern frontend, with attention to clean UX and accessibility. I’m most comfortable in C++ and Python, and I like blending engineering with creativity through design and visual tools. Outside of tech, I’m driven by education, art, and health, they shape how I learn, build, and collaborate. I believe with the current capabilities of AI, programmers should strive to be proficient in coding by producing their own code. This allows us to make erros, learn and ultimatly become better in the field of Computer Science.
